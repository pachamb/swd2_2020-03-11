Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery.
Jane is a Data Scientist and Samit is a Statistician.

We may need to bring a third person on to this project.
They may need to be competent in Python and R.
Matplotlib and version control skills will also be useful.


I'll refer you to my notes in analysis.txt. Such project notes are now unnecessary,
because we probably don't need to bother.
